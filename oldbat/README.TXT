APOGEE SOFTWARE
EPISODIC GAMES ANSI LAUNCHERS

First Release - 2014/06/27


 1. Introduction
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This pack includes a bunch of launchers for older Apogee games where each
episode was divided into a separate executable file.

The reason for this division probably had to do with memory as well as
convenience when selling them separately.

Today though, having each episode separate is more of a burden especially if
you set up some kind of gaming system. Setting up a simple batch file is of
course easy, but I thought it would be nice to have launchers that feel a bit
more immersive than just a simple CHOICE batch file. The goal during the
creation was to use official ANSI art as far as it was available or usable in a
practical way.

All of the launchers have been tested to work correctly using DOSBox 0.74.
Using them in the Windows Command Prompt is not recommended and they will most
likely not work correctly. They should however function without problems in a
real MS-DOS environment as well.

Each of these launchers have been designed with the most recent version of the
game sold by Apogee Software in mind. In other words, titles and copyright
years displayed are those of the most recent version and not necessarily that
of the original release.

Certain titles have also had unique versions sold by alternate distributors.
These are also not covered in this pack and the launchers may not necessarily
work with these versions.

* SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING COMMANDER KEEN GALAXY AND ALIENS LAUNCHERS!
These launchers support the ability to choose between the EGA and CGA versions
of the games.

The Commander Keen: Goodbye, Galaxy! launcher will automatically detect if the
EGA, CGA or both versions are present and alter its choices accordingly.

The Aliens Ate My Baby Sitter! launcher requires you to name your executables
KEEN6C.EXE (for the CGA version) and KEEN6E.EXE (for the EGA version) in order
to function properly. If you only have one of the versions installed, the
launcher is useless since the game isn't episodic.

As saved games are incompatible between these versions, the launcher will warn
you if you change graphic modes and saved games are present.

 3. Installation            
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installation is very easy. Simply copy the batch file of the game you want to
use it in into a folder with all the game episodes present and use the batch
file to start the game in the future.

 4. Legal Stuff
